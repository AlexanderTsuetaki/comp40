   [RODRIGUEZ] "I CAN TELL YOU THAT THOSE WERE NEITHER SALVADORAN NOR
HONDURAN PLANES.here  IN MY OPINION, THE SANDINISTS WANT TO INVENT AN EXCUSE TO
CONTINUE HELPING THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT].here  OURS
AND THE HONDURAN PLANES ARE SMALL PLANES.here  I DO NOT THINK THAT HONDURAN
PLANES ENTERED NICARAGUAN TERRITORY.here  THOSE COMMUNISTS ARE TRYING TO INVENT

   CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] GOODBYE [AIR FORCE COMMANDER] GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, FALSE
HOPE FOR MASS KILLERS.here  GEN.here  BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS
THE AIR FORCE CHIEF.here  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT
WITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.here  BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN
OF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.hereS.here COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL
SALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER.here

   FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.hereS.here SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE
AIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE
DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.here  THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE
COUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN,
TOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE
GENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN
EL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO.here  BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS
AND U.hereS.here AMBASSADORS HAVE.here  AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE
IMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN
EL SALVADOR.here

   AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE
OF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS.here  HE ACCUSES [FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER
EUGENIO] VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN.here  ONE
WOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS
MOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS,
MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT
MURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.here  WAS THE U.hereS.here PENTAGON SOFT
WHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF
GENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY?here

   THE U.hereS.here STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE
PAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT
REBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED
HAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE.here  BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY.here

   THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND.here  THROUGH AN
ACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE.here  BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES
GENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE.here  BUSTILLO
ACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE
TOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.here  A
POLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR
SECTORS.here  OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY.here
BUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR
DEMOCRACY.here  IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL
OPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT
SUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY.here  IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS
NOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION.here  THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS
IT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT
THEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES:
TO STOP THE FMLN.here

   THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF
THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG
DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID.here  THE JESUITS' MURDERS
AND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING
FOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS.here  HOWEVER, THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN
OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF] AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER
THIS RESPONSIBILITY.here  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS.here

   BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL
BEGIN IN THE U.hereS.here CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID.here  BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S
SCAPEGOAT.here  HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS
MACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE.here  WILL THE U.hereS.here PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE
APPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY?here  TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE
OBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR.here  WHILE PEOPLES
OF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO
LEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER,
COMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH,
THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE.here  GOODBYE, GEN.here BUSTILLO.here  WE CONTINUE
WRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU.here  THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY,
INDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.here  THAT IS WHY FOREIGN INTERVENTION AND
THE WALLS OF INTOLERANCE HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE THE
PEOPLE GROW IN HEROISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IS NOT DETERRED BY
BOMBINGS.here

   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY TODAY
PREVENTED THE OCCUPATION OF CITIES IN THE EASTERN PART OF EL SALVADOR,
WAGING STRONG CLASHES BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND DAWN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY
MILITARY SOURCES.here

   THE ATTACKS, ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, TOOK PLACE IN USULUTAN, USULUTAN
DEPARTMENT, 110 KM EAST OF THE CAPITAL, AND IN SANTA ELENA WHERE AS OF 0700
CLASHES WERE STILL UNDER WAY.here  SANTA ELENA IS LOCATED 119 KM EAST OF THE
CAPITAL, AND BOTH CITIES ARE COFFEE REGIONS.here

   IN USULUTAN, 6TH BRIGADE TROOPS AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT BATTALIONS REPELLED
THE INCURSION WITH ARTILLERY FIRE.here  DURING THE 2D WEEK OF DECEMBER, THERE HAD
BEEN STRONG CLASHES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN, IN WHAT THE GUERRILLAS
CALLED THE "BATTLE OF EL NISPERAL," IN THE CANTON THAT BEARS THE SAME NAME,
WHICH COST THE ARMY 29 DEAD, ALTHOUGH IT HAS ONLY ADMITTED TO 21 DEATHS.here

   IN SANTA ELENA THE CLASHES WERE ALSO STRONG, BUT SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO
REPORTS OF CASUALTIES ON EITHER SIDE.here

   FROM SAN VICENTE, IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY, WHERE THE
CHICHONTEPEC VOLCANO IS LOCATED, STRONG CLASHES WERE REPORTED, AND THE 5TH
BRIGADE BOMBED REBEL POSITIONS ON THE COLCANO, WHERE THE FMLN HAS STRONG
BASTIONS.here

   THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IS CARRYING OUT OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN SAN
SALVADOR.here  AND ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL THIS MORNING POWERFUL
EXPLOSIONS, CHARACTERIZED AS MILITARY ACTIONS TO PREVENT REBELS FROM
GATHERING, COULD BE HEARD.here  THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST, THERE WERE ATTEMPTS TO
ENTER THE CAPITAL FROM THAT DIRECTION.here

   THE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS SURVEILLANCE TO PREVENT MOBILIZATIONS, AND
THROUGH CAREFUL SEARCHES VEHICLES ARE BEING CONTROLLED AT THE CAPITAL CITY'S
ENTRANCES AND EXITS.here

   IN OTHER ACTIONS, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE REPORTED AT LEAST SIX
FMLN DEATHS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.here

   SANTIAGO, 9 JAN 90 -- [COMMENTARY] [OLGA KLIVADENKO] [TEXT] THE
DEPLOYMENT OF U.hereS.here  SHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER "JOHN F.here
KENNEDY" AND THE CORVETTE "VIRGINIA" ALONG THE COLOMBIAN COAST YESTERDAY,
SEEKING TO INTERCEPT DRUG TRAFFICKING ROUTES, COULD BE THE RESULT OF THREE
POLICIES:

   FIRST, THAT THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO JUSTIFY THE INVASION OF PANAMA
UNDER THE EXCUSE OF ITS FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.here

   SECOND, THAT BOTH THE DEPLOYMENT OF SHIPS AND THE INVASION OF PANAMA ARE
PART OF A SERIOUS MILITARY PLAN TO END THE DRUG PLAGUE.here

   THIRD, THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST SOMEHOW JUSTIFY THE INVASION OF PANAMA
AND THE NEED TO RECOVER ITS INTERNATIONAL IMAGE HAS PROVIDED A REAL
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT AN END TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.here

   IF THE OBJECTIVE REALLY IS TO ELIMINATE DRUGS, THEN THE BATTLE IS
PRAISEWORTHY, BUT--LIKE IN PANAMA--THE PROCEDURE IS PAINFUL, OVERBEARING,
IMPERIALISTIC, AND HUMILIATING.here  INSTEAD OF WINNING THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES' APPRECIATION AND SOLIDARITY WITH THIS LAUDABLE CAUSE, THE UNITED
STATES IS AGAIN PROVOKING ANGRY REACTIONS AND DEEP DISTRUST.here  THE SIDE
EFFECTS OF THIS ACTION COULD BE VERY NEGATIVE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING, IN WHICH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THIS CONTINENT SHOULD BE
COOPERATING.here  ALTERNATIVELY, WOULD IT BE BETTER IF THEY DID NOT COOPERATE IN
THIS PHASE?here

   COULD IT BE THAT WHAT WE HAVE CALLED IMPERIALISTIC CLUMSINESS,
INSENSIBILITY, AND ABUSE, IS SIMPLY A DELIBERATE STRATEGY WITH WHICH,
PERHAPS FOR WELL FOUNDED REASONS AND EVEN AT THE RISK OF DIPLOMATIC
CONFLICTS, THE UNITED STATES SEEKS TO ISOLATE LATIN AMERICA ON PURPOSE AND
THUS ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF ITS OPERATION?here  IF THIS WERE THE CASE THEN WE
MUST ASK, WHY?here

   FROM ITS OPERATIONS IN PANAMA AND COLOMBIA, THE UNITED STATES IS TELLING
US THAT IT IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE DIPLOMATIC ASPECT FOR THE TIME BEING.here
THE UNITED STATES WANTS ACTION AND EFFICIENCY.here  THE UNITED STATES IS LOSING
ITS PATIENCE, AND PERHAPS ITS CONFIDENCE IN THE SERIOUSNESS AND CAPABILITY OF
LATIN AMERICA TO FACE THIS WAR.here

   IF THE ACTION IN COLOMBIA GOES FURTHER THAN A MERE SURVEILLANCE, THE
UNITED STATES WILL BE ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT IN THIS BATTLE AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.here  THIS MEANS THAT DURING A FIRST PHASE THE UNITED STATES WILL
CARRY OUT A MILITARY OPERATION BY ITSELF.here  DURING A SECOND PHASE IT WILL
DISCUSS SECONDARY SUBJECTS BUT WITH LESS URGENCY IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG
TRAFFICKING.here

   NEXT 15 FEBRUARY, BUSH WILL MEET IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, COLOMBIA, WITH
HIS COLOMBIAN, PERUVIAN, AND BOLIVIAN COUNTERPARTS.here  PERHAPS ON THAT OCCASION
THEY WILL TALK ABOUT THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS WAR: THE REORGANIZATION OF
THE LOCAL ECONOMIES TO END THE DEPENDENCY ON COCA PLANTATIONS, THE RECOVERY
OF DRUG ADDICTS, AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF GOVERNMENTS, ETC.here

   DURING THIS CURRENT PHASE, HOWEVER, THE UNITED STATES WISHES TO ACT ALONE.here
WHO KNOWS IF IT IS BECAUSE OF LATIN AMERICA'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING?here  AS WE
SAID A FEW DAYS AGO, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM IS CREATING NEW SITUATIONS
IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.here  THE U.hereS.here PROPOSAL IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE:
COULD A WORLD POWER LIKE THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO IGNORE A SERIOUS
PROBLEM LIKE THE PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS, MERELY
TO AVOID HARMING LATIN AMERICAN SENSIBILITIES, SENSIBILITIES OF COUNTRIES
WHOSE GOVERNMENTS ARE ALWAYS MUDDLED UP IN USELESS DIPLOMATIC AND
BUREAUCRATIC PROCEDURES AND FRUITLESS NEGOTIATIONS?here  AND ALL THIS WHILE A
LARGE PART OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD'S POPULATION IS BECOMING ADDICTED TO A
DEADLY PRODUCT?here

   THE UNITED STATES COULD ALSO BE ASKING ITSELF: HAVE THE LATIN AMERICAN
GOVERNMENTS BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM BY THEMSELVES?here  CAN
THOSE GOVERNMENTS STOP DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT DRUGS AND
CORRUPTION GO HAND IN HAND; WHEN IN THE PAST AND PERHAPS IN THE PRESENT,
HIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN LINKED WITH THIS ILLEGAL TRADE
AND PROTECTING THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS?here  WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER ALL THIS
HASN'T THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO EXTRADITE THE MAIN CHIEFS OF THAT
CARTEL TO THE UNITED STATES?here

   LET US RECALL THE HORRIBLE EXPLOSION OF THE COLOMBIAN AIRLINER, IN WHICH
MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE DIED; THE BOMB EXPLOSION IN THE SECRET POLICE
HEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA; THE MURDER OF MANY JOURNALISTS WHO WERE ENGAGED IN
AN HEROIC WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING; AND MAINLY, LET US RECALL THE
EVER-PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST BE FACED WHEN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS
MUST BE PUNISHED AND EXTRADITED.here

SATISFACTION WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND
IS ENCOURAGING THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF
THIS CRIME.here

   MONSIGNOR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ TODAY STATED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS
PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS.here  HE SAID THAT IF THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED IN THE KILLING ARE
PUNISHED, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ONLY EARN INTERNATIONAL PRESTIGE, BUT WILL
LAY THE GROUNDWORK TO CONSOLIDATE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL
SALVADOR.here

   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT IF THE KILLING IS SOLVED, THE PERIOD OF IMPUNITY
THAT HAS TARNISHED THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND COVERED UP A NUMBER OF CRIMES TO
WHICH JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED WILL END.here

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ROSA CHAVEZ] IT SEEMS THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE
RECOGNIZED FOR HAVING HAD THE COURAGE TO KEEP HIS PROMISE TO CONDUCT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.here  WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS NOT YET REVEALED THE
DETAILS OF THIS CRIME BUT THAT HE WILL DO SO SOON.here

   HOWEVER, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN SAID: THE CHURCH IS NOT
INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHO THE MURDERERS ARE JUST FOR THE TRUTH TO COME
OUT.here  THE CHURCH WANTS THIS PUNISHMENT TO MEAN THAT IMPUNITY HAS ENDED IN EL
SALVADOR; THAT THE POOR WILL FEEL CERTAIN THAT JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL FOR
THEM; THAT SO MANY CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN WILL BE SOLVED LITTLE BY
LITTLE; BUT MAINLY, THAT FROM NOW ON, CRIMES WILL NO LONGER GO UNSOLVED.here
[END RECORDING]

   MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ ADDED THAT THE TONE OF VERBAL VIOLENCE MUST BE LOWERED
SINCE THIS ONLY RESULTS IN A USELESS CONFRONTATION AND PROMOTES A
POLARIZATION OF THE CONFLICT, AS WELL AS HINDERS ANY EFFORT TO APPLY
JUSTICE.here  HE SAID THAT THE VERBAL WAR IS AS HARMFUL AS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.here
HE SAID THAT IRRESPONSIBLE CHARGES AND ACCUSATIONS CONTINUE IN THE COUNTRY,
AND THEY DO NOT HELP STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS.here

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ROSA CHAVEZ] IT IS IMPORTANT TO OVERCOME VERBAL
VIOLENCE.here  THIS MEANS THAT A CALM CLIMATE, A CLIMATE THAT IS AS IMPARTIAL AS
POSSIBLE, MUST BE SOUGHT TO DISCUSS ISSUES.here  WE RECALL THAT LAST YEAR, MANY
VIOLENT STATEMENTS WERE MADE.here  MANY HARSH EXPRESSIONS WERE UTTERED.here  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] TOO MANY HEATED STATEMENTS PRINTED IN SOME NEWSPAPERS.here  THE
LANGUAGE USED IS TOO HARSH.here  I THINK THAT TO OBTAIN JUSTICE, WE NEED A

   CLANDESTINE, 11 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL
COMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)]
[TEXT] REGARDING THE JESUITS' CASE, THE FMLN STATES THAT:

   1.here THE FMLN AND SEVERAL SECTORS, INCLUDING YOUNG ARMED FORCES OFFICERS,
WERE RIGHT IN POINTING TO THE ARMY AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HORRIBLE
CRIME.here  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED INSTITUTION FOR THIS CASE AND THE
CASES INVOLVING FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION],
MONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE NUNS, AND THE U.hereS.here AGRARIAN EXPERTS, AS WELL AS FOR
THE BOMBINGS IN THE CITIES AND MASSACRES IN THE RURAL SECTOR, SHOW THAT WE
WERE RIGHT WHEN WE MENTIONED IN OUR LAST PEACE PROPOSAL THE NEED TO CLEAN UP
THE ARMY AND REFORM THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.here

   2.here TO ADVANCE IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE
THIS CASE.here  THE OTHER CASES NEED TO BE SOLVED AND THOSE GUILTY FOR THEM
SHOULD BE PUNISHED.here  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES CANNOT REMAIN AT
THE LEVEL OF OFFICERS AND TROOPS WHO ONLY CARRIED OUT ORDERS.here  MOST
IMPORTANT IS TO ESTABLISH RESPONSIBILITY AMONG HIGHER-RANKING OFFICERS
BECAUSE A DECISION OF THIS SORT COULD NOT BE BEYOND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
THE TOP COMMAND.here

   3.here IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS
CONCERNING DEMOCRATIZATION; REFORMING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; LIFTING THE STATE
OF EMERGENCY; REESTABLISHING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MOBILIZATION, AND
ORGANIZATION; RELEASING THE MORE THAN 3,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND
STOPPING THE REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS.here  

   4.here THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY CRISTIANI IS AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE COMPLICATED
DISCUSSIONS ON U.hereS.here AID FOR EL SALVADOR AND TO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS
AID TO MAINTAIN THE WAR.here  IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO INCREASE AID TO THE
SALVADORAN ARMY BECAUSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR BECAUSE THE CASE MAY BE
RESOLVED.here  SUCH AID WOULD LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING A CASE LIKE
THAT OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS HAPPENING AGAIN.here  THE BEST WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS TO CEASE AID.here  WE APPEAL TO THE U.hereS.here CONGRESS TO MAKE
THIS DECISION.here  IF THIS IS DONE, THE FMLN WOULD COMMIT ITSELF TO MAKING
EFFORTS TO REACH AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.here

   5.here FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS DEPEND ON JUSTICE-MAKING
PROGRESS.here  IF THE ARMY IS THOROUGHLY PURGED BECAUSE OF THIS CASE, PEACE
COULD BE REACHED EARLIER.here

   6.here TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A PROMPT PEACE, WE WILL ASK THE OFFICE OF THE UN
SECRETARY GENERAL TO MEDIATE.here  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO JOINTLY MEET WITH
US AND WITH MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS TO RENEW THE
DIALOGUE-NEGOTIATION PROCESS.here

   7.here THE FMLN WILL BE WATCHING HOW THE SITUATION DEVELOPS.here  IT URGES
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO EXERT PRESSURE SO THAT THE
INVESTIGATION PROCESS DOES NOT END WITH A DECLARATION OF INTENTION OR WITH
STATEMENTS BLAMING LOW-RANKING SOLDIERS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE MOST
RESPONSIBLE.here  THIS WOULD PUSH AWAY THE POSSIBILTIY OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION
TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.here

   BOGOTA, 11 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES, THE FARC [REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA] LAUNCHED A NEW
OFFENSIVE TO RECOVER THE REGION OF MIDDLE MAGDALENA THAT WAS LOST TO GONZALO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS MEN 5 YEARS AGO.here  THIS IS THE REASON FOR FIERCE
FIGHTING THERE BETWEEN THE ARMY AND SEVERAL FARC FRONTS DURING THE FIRST FEW
DAYS OF THIS YEAR.here  HEAVILY ARMED AND STRENGTHENED THESE FRONTS ARE TRYING
TO MILITARILY TAKE OVER AREAS THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA'S DEPUTIES HAVE BEEN
VACATING BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS CREATED IN THEIR ORGANIZATION BY THE DEATH OF
EL MEJICANO [GONZALO RODRIGUEZ' ALIAS].here

   THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT THE RETURN TO THE STRATEGY OF USING
KIDNAPPINGS AS A MEANS TO FINANCE ITSELF IS ALSO PART OF THIS NEW OFFENSIVE
THAT SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING THE SUPPORT OF OTHER GUERRILLA GROUPS SUCH AS THE
EPL [POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY].here

   MEANWHILE, IN LA URIBE THE FARC GENERAL SECRETARIAT HAS SUBMITTED ANOTHER
PEACE PROPOSAL TO PRESIDENT BARCO.here  THE GUERRILLA GROUP STATES THAT IT IS
WILLING TO ESTABLISH A NEW POLITICAL PARTY CALLED BOLIVARIAN REUNION OF THE
PEOPLE [REUNION BOLIVARIANA DEL PUEBLO] IF THE GOVERNMENT CALLS A PLESBICITE
TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.here

   THE PROPOSAL WAS RECEIVED ON 9 JANUARY DIRECTLY FROM THE HANDS OF FARC
LEADERS BY MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORY BOARD FOR PEACE ISSUES.here

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [RAFAEL PARDO, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR FOR PEACE AND
REHABILITATION] THE GOVERNMENT MUST ASSESS THE PROPOSAL IT HAS RECEIVED, AS
WELL AS FARC'S SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT SHOULD RESUME

   ROME (ITALY), 11 JAN 90 -- [INTERVIEW WITH DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE
LEADER RUBEN ZAMORA BY ALESSANDRO OPPES] [EXCERPT] [PASSAGE OMITTED]
[OPPES] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS
DESCRIBED THE ARREST OF FIVE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THE
MASSACRE [OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS] AS "A MANIPULATED COVER OPERATION.here"
BASICALLY, CRISTIANI IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DECIDED TO PUNISH A NUMBER OF
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS TO CLOSE THE CASE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO
END INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES.here  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION IN THIS REGARD?here

   [ZAMORA] THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MEMBERS OF
THE ARMY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASSACRE IS A FIRST STEP AND DEFINITELY A
GOOD THING, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY INSUFFICIENT UNLESS THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS ARE
ALSO TAKEN.here  FIRST, TO IDENTIFY WHO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE:  THIS IS
THE FIRST IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE NOBODY CAN FEEL SATISFIED IF ONLY
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS ARE IDENTIFIED.here  SUCH AN ACT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN ORDERED
BY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS.here  WE MUST NOT FORGET THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO,
FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SENTENCES AND NO TRIALS.here

   [OPPES] HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY DENIED
INVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATION, STATING THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED ACTION
"DIVORCED FROM ANY INSTITUTIONAL POLICY.here"

   [ZAMORA] I BELIEVE THIS IS ENTIRELY WRONG: THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT
FATHERS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISOLATED ACTION.here  OVER 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE
DIED IN EL SALVADOR DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, AND 90 PERCENT OF THEM WERE
CIVILIANS.here  POLITICAL ASSASSINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES IS A CONSTANT
PRACTICE.here  FURTHERMORE, TORTURE IS REGULARLY PRACTISED IN EL SALVADOR.here  THE
ARMY HIGH COMMAND CANNOT FAIL TO KNOW THIS.here  THEY CANNOT CLAIM TO BE
INNOCENT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS.here

   [OPPES] YET LAST MONTH THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HEADS OF STATE IN
SAN JOSE ENDED WITH A SUCCESS FOR PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHO SECURED AN
EXPLICIT CONDEMNATION OF THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GUERRILLAS IN
NOVEMBER, WHEREAS NO SPECIFIC CHARGES WERE LEVELED AT THE GOVERNMENT FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.here

   [ZAMORA] THERE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND, NAMELY,
THE CALL FROM THE FIVE PRESIDENTS FOR A RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE IN EL
SALVADOR AND THE APPEAL TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO CARRY OUT MEDIATION
TO THIS END.here  BUT IN THE SUMMIT'S FINAL DOCUMENT, IT IS THE FMLN AND THE
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS WHO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PRESIDENTS:
THESE ARE DIPLOMATIC GAMES THAT DO NOT FACILITATE THE RESTORATION OF PEACE
IN CENTRAL AMERICA.here

   [OPPES] WHAT PATHS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO ADVANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS?here

   [ZAMORA] NEGOTIATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY NECESSARY.here  THE GUERRILLA
OFFENSIVE SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS A STRONG MILITARY FORCE, BUT ALSO THAT A
REVOLUTIONARY ATTITUDE DOES NOT EXIST AMONG THE MASSES.here  IT ALSO SHOWS THAT
THE GOVERNMENT ARMY, AFTER 10 YEARS OF U.hereS.here TRAINING, IS AN ARMY WHOSE
MILITARY STANCE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE (WHICH IS THE KEY TO U.hereS.here
MILITARY STRATEGY.here)  WHILE THIS ALL SHOWS THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT PRECISELY FOLLOWING
THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE (AND THIS IS THE PARADOX) THE ARMY STIFFENED ITS
STANCE AGAINST NEGOTIATIONS.here  I BELIEVE THAT SOONER OR LATER COMMON SENSE
WILL PREVAIL AND IT WILL SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.here  AT THE END OF
NOVEMBER THE U.hereS.here SECRETARY OF STATE'S ASSISTANT FOR LATIN AMERICA SPOKE
OFFICIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE THE
CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGN OF A CHANGING SITUATION.here

HAMPERING THE INVESTIGATION.here

   THE COLONEL SAID: "WE HOPE THAT THE NAMES WILL BE REVEALED SOON AND THAT

   OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OCHOA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST AN INTERNAL
STRUGGLE WITHIN THE RULING ARENA, EXPRESS AN IMPLICIT WISH TO SEE THIS
ABOMINABLE CRIME RESOLVED.here"

   THE RETIRED COLONEL ADDED THAT THE "COURAGEOUS" POSITION OF CRISTIANI
REGARDING THIS CASE HAS BROUGHT HIM STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS
HELPING TO STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT
WANTS TO PROMOTE.here

   ALTHOUGH OCHOA ADMITTED THAT IN EL SALVADOR MILITARY POWER HAS BEEN BEHIND
THE REAL POWER AND THAT TRYING A MILITARY MAN HAS BEEN TABOO, HE SAID THAT
CRISTIANI "IS DETERMINED TO INTENSIFY A PURGE OF SUCH ELEMENTS FROM THE
ARMED FORCES.here"

   HE ALSO ADMITTED "THAT THERE ARE STILL SALVADORAN MILITARY MEN WHO BELIEVE
THAT THEY HOLD POWER AND THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR RIFLES AND THE POWER THAT

   CLANDESTINE, 12 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] THE
U.hereS.here  CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES ARE FILLED WITH SURPRISES.here  THEY ARE TO
RENEW THEIR SESSIONS IN 2 WEEKS' TIME, AND IMPORTANT MATTERS ARE
WAITING TO BE DISCUSSED.here

   AFTER THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] STARTED ITS 11
NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE WHICH BURIED THE ARMY'S PROPAGANDISTIC CLAIMS THAT IT HAD
FINISHED OFF THE GUERRILLAS, ALONG CAME THE GREAT SURPRISES IN THE EAST
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHEN THEY BROUGHT DOWN WALLS WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO
MILITARY INVASIONS AND ATTAINED A DEMOCRATIC OPENING.here  ENDING THE YEAR, THE
WORLD WAS SURPRISED WITH THE BRUTAL U.hereS.here INVASION OF PANAMA.here

   NOW, WHEN THE LAST DECADE OF THE CENTURY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN, EL SALVADOR
ADDS ANOTHER PAGE TO THE BOOK OF LAST-MINUTE SURPRISES.here  ALFREDO CRISTIANI
HIMSELF--WHO, TOGETHER WITH ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, SAID HOURS AFTER THE
JESUITS AND THEIR MAIDS HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT THERE WERE SUSPICIONS THAT
THE FMLN COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE--HAS JUST ACCEPTED, ESPECIALLY
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE U.hereS.here CONGRESS, THAT ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL WERE THE
ONES WHO MURDERED THE TOP BRAINS, THE BEST INTELLECTUALS OF EL SALVADOR.here
THE MURDERERS WERE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND, AT LEAST ON THE NATIONAL
TELEVISON NETWORK, CRISTIANI PROMISED TO DISLOSE THEIR NAMES.here  [PASSAGE
INDISTINCT].here.here.hereTHE JESUITS' MURDERS OR THE CANCELLATION OF AID.here

   IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ARMY--WHICH MURDERED MONSIGNO OSCAR ROMERO, 1,000
PEASANTS IN EL MOZOTE, 70 INDIANS IN LAS HOJAS, HUNDREDS OF SALVADORANS IN
ZUNPU, AND UNIONISTS AT THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION
FEDERATION] OFFICES, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE ARMED FORCES' WELL-KNOWN
CRIMES--IS GOING TO BE PURGED AT LAST, IF THIS IS REALLY TRUE, THEN WE WOULD
HAVE TO SAY THAT A TRUE NEGOTIATION WILL START.here  IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS
MADE PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR.here  

   ONE OF OUR DEMANDS, A REALISTIC DEMAND TO PROPITIATE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR,
IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PURGE OF THE ARMY.here  IN MEXCIO AND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA
RICA, WE SAID THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT ACCEPT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL, THE
NATION WOULD DO SO.here  AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.here  THE NATION DEMANDS THAT
THE ARMED FORCES BE PURGED.here

   THE MOST IMPORTANT U.hereS.here NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSCASTS HAVE NOTED THE
IRREFUTABLE FACT THAT 10 YEARS OF U.hereS.here ADVICE AND AN INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN
$3 BILLION--VERY CLOSE TO $4 BILLION--TO CREATE A HUGE BUILDUP IN THEIR
ARMAMENTS HAVE NOT SERVED TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF AN ARMY THAT MURDERED
MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS, INCLUDING NUNS AND U.hereS.here
ADVISERS.here  WE BELIEVE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD WAS MISTAKEN WHEN
HE SAID THAT U.hereS.here AID IN ITSELF WAS NOT BEING DISCUSSED.here  THE 10 YEARS OF
AID, ADVICE, AND U.hereS.here STRATEGY IN EL SALVADOR HAVE PROVEN TO BE A FAILURE.here
IF THE UNITED STATES HAS ANY INTENTIONS OF CONTRIBUTING TO PEACE, NOW IS THE
TIME TO CHANGE ITS POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR.here

   EVENTS HAVE PLACED THE ISSUE OF THE CONTINUATION OF AID TO EL SALVADOR ON
THE CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES.here  THE AID WAS MADE CONDITIONAL ON PUNISHMENT
FOR THE JESUITS' MURDERS.here  BUT WHAT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY?here  IT IS A
DECISION THAT GOES BEYOND A BASIC DEMAND FOR JUSTICE.here  IT WILL DETERMINE THE
CONTINUATION OF U.hereS.here AID.here  IT ENTAILS THE DECISION TO TURN THEIR POLICY
AROUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR.here  THEY ARE TO
DISCUSS WHETHER CONGRESS' POSITION IS TO BE: ONE, WE APPROVE THE PURGE OF
THE ARMY AND THUS WE WILL GIVE THEM MORE AID, OR, TWO, WE APPROVE THE PURGE
AS A CONCRETE STEP TO DEMOCRATIZATION AND WILL SUSPEND MILITARY AID SO THAT
THESE CONDITIONS CAN BE USED TO REACH A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.here

   WILL U.hereS.here CONGRESSMEN BE CAPABLE OF SURPRISING THE WORLD BY HELPING THE
SALVADORANS TO TOPPLE THE FASCIST WALL, THE WALL OF WAR?here  WILL THEY DO THIS
BY STOPPING MILITARY AID?here  THE FMLN HAS SAID CLEARLY THAT IF THE UNITED
STATES STOPS AID TO THE ARMY IT WILL CORRESPOND WITH ACTIONS TO REACH A
COMPLETE HALT IN HOSTILITIES.here  WE HOPE THE U.hereS.here CONGRESS DOES NOT MAKE A
MISTAKE.here  IF IT STOPS AID, IF IT CUTS IT, IF IT ENDS IT, WE WILL STAND
BEFORE A CLEAR AND HOPEFUL SIGN FOR PEACE.here  HOWEVER, IF NOT, WE WILL STAND
BEFORE YET ANOTHER SIGN OF WAR, AND THE SURPRISE WILL NOT BE A GOOD ONE.here

REGARDING THE ASSASSINATION OF HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE AND
SECRETARY FOR LATIN AMERICA OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, IN
GUATEMALA ON 12 JANUARY, WE STATE:

   1.here WE BLAME ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], THE REGIME OF

ITS ARMED FORCES FOR THIS DETESTABLE ASSASSINATION.here  THE LINKS BETWEEN

THE REGION.here

   2.here THIS NEW CRIME AND THE RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE CASE OF THE

ITS PLAN TO ANNIHILATE EVERY TYPE OF OPPOSITION.here

   3.here THE ASSASSINATION OF DR OQUELI AND HIS COMPANION, GILDA FLORES, THE
EXTENSION OF THE STATE OF THE SIEGE, AND THE FACT THAT NOTHING INDICATES
THAT THERE WILL BE PUNISHMENT FOR THE MASTERMINDS OF THE MASSACRE OF 16
NOVEMBER SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE
LATTER CASE IS ONLY A FARCE TO OBTAIN U.hereS.here AID AND TO PROCEED WITH THE
SLAUGHTER OF OPPOSITION MEMBERS.here

   4.here AS THOSE EVENTS SHOW, THE POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFICT REQUIRES A
PURGE OF THE ARMED FORCES, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.here  THERE
CAN BE NO DIALOGUE AMID STATE TERRORISM, A STATE OF SIEGE, AND GENERAL
TRAMPLING ON HUMAN RIGHTS.here  UNDER THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE REGIME GIVES

NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) TODAY DEMANDED THAT GUATEMALAN

LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND OF GUATEMALAN ATTORNEY GILDA FLORES.here

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE MNR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CONDEMNED THE
"ABOMINABLE" CRIME PERPETRATED ON 12 JANUARY IN GUATEMALA BY ARMED MEN
WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES.here  THE MNR ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF MNR SECRETARY GENERAL GUILLERMO UNGO,
WHO WILL ARRIVE IN EL SALVADOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO ATTEND OQUELI'S
FUNERAL, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR 15 JANUARY.here

   OQUELI, 45, AND GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY

AFTERNOON THAT A COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, ONE SECOND LIEUTENANT, TWO
SECOND SERGEANTS, AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE OF
THE JESUITS.here

   THE ACCUSATION AGAINST COLONEL BENAVIDES IS THE FOLLOWING: THAT THE
MULTIPLE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN THE SECTOR UNDER HIS COMMAND.here  FROM THE
LIEUTENANT ON DOWN, THE ACCUSATION IS THAT THEY DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE
CRIME.here  [WORDS INDISTINCT], AS CRISTIANI SAID, THAT IT WAS COL BENAVIDES,
BUT IT WAS NOT COL BENAVIDES WHO ISSUED THE ORDER.here  SO, THE QUESTION IS: WHO
GAVE THE ORDER TO KILL THE JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS.here  IN OUR VIEW, COL
BENAVIDES WAS IMPLICATED SOLELY AS A MEANS OF PROPAGANDA AIMED AT THE U.hereS.here
CONGRESS.here  IT IS CLEAR THAT COL BENAVIDES DID NOT GIVE THE ORDER.here  HE
PROBABLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE ACTION.here  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT
WE KNOW ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.here  FIRST, HE IS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE CARRIED OUT
ACTS OF REPRESSION OR CORRUPTION.here  OUR REPORT INDICATES THAT BENAVIDES HAS
   MAINTAINED A POSITION IN FAVOR OF INSTITUTIONS AND OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS.here
HE WAS DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE, STUDIOUS AND NOT REPRESSIVE CADET, ONE OF THE
FEW EXCEPTIONS IN LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1977 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE
CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].here  IN OTHER WORDS, FOR THE
LA TANDONA, A GANG OF ASSASSINS, HE IS A PERFECT SCAPEGOAT.here

   THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUITS WAS NOT A PERSONAL DECISION.here  IT WAS PART OF
THE ARMED FORCES' COUNTEROFFENSIVE ACTIONS DURING THE NOVEMBER BATTLES.here  IT
WAS A COLD-BLOODED, PREMEDITATED PLAN EXECUTED TO DECAPITATE THE PEOPLE'S
MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION.here  LET US REMEMBER THE THREATS AGAINST
FATHER ELLACURIA OVER THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK PRIOR TO THE
ASSASSINATION.here  LET US REMEMBER THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 15 NOVEMBER AND
EARLY MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SEVERAL OFFICES OF LABOR UNIONS AND HOUSES OF
OPPOSITION MEMBERS WERE ATTACKED.here  LET US REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE MASSSACRE
OF THE JESUITS, THE OFFICERS SHOUTED OVER LOUDSPEAKERS THAT THEY HAD KILLED
ELLACURIA AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE KILLING COMMUNISTS.here  THE
BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS.here

   IN OUR VIEW, THE ASSASSINS OF THE JESUITS WERE THOSE WHO APPEARED ON THE
RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK MAKING KNOWN THE RESULTS OF THE SO-CALLED HONOR
COMMISSION.here  COL BENAVIDES WILL PROBABLY BE FREED IN A SHORT TIME AND BE
APPOINTED TO SOME POST ABROAD, OR HE MIGHT EXPERIENCE THE SAME FATE AS THAT
OF CAPTAIN EDUARDO ALFONSO AVILA, WHO WENT IN AND OUT OF JAIL EACH TIME THAT
MILITARY AID FOR EL SALVADOR WAS DISCUSSED IN THE U.hereS.here CONGRESS.here

   HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE AND AS HAS ALWAYS OCCURRED, IT WILL BE THE
LIEUTENANTS, THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND THE SOLDIERS WHO CARRIED OUT
AN ORDER WHO WILL PAY THE CONSEQUENCES.here  WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN
THE CASES OF THE NUNS WHEN [WORDS INDISTINCT] A FEW SOLDIERS, THE MASSACRE
OF SAN FRANCISCO, AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE U.hereS.here ADVISERS AND RODOLFO
VIERA.here  [WORDS INDISTINCT] ONCE AGAIN THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE FRUSTRATED, AS
HAS HAPPENED IN SO MANY OTHER CASES.here

   THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS AGAIN CONFIRMS THAT TO, AS CRISTIANI
SAID, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, WE HAVE TO OBTAIN DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND
SELF-DETERMINATION.here

THEY HAVE MAINTAINED AND SHOULD RESPECT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE WITHOUT
IT, NO NATION CAN ACHIEVE HARMONY AND DEVELOPMENT.here

   THE SEDITIOUS "SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE ALONE AND THAT NO ONE
SUPPORTS THEIR ANARCHIC PLAN," THE ARENA PRESIDENT ADDED.here  HE RECALLED THAT
DURING THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPORTED THE
ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN NEVER RECEIVED ANY SUPPORT.here

   CALDERON SOL STRESSED THAT THE FMLN MUST PROVIDE REAL PROOF THAT IT WANTS
TO REACH PEACE THROUGH NEGOTIATED MEANS, BECAUSE PRESIDENT CRISTIANI HAS GOOD
INTENTIONS AND WANTS TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THROUGH TALKS.here

   THE SUBVERSIVES MUST SUSPEND THE AGGRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT BE AT THE

   TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA BY JULIO
ARMANDO VALDES] [EXCERPT] [AZCONA] .here.here.hereWHICH HAS DISMAYED ALL HONDURAN
PEOPLE.here  THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS KIND OF ACTION--THE MURDER
OF [RETIRED] GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ--WHICH WAS POLITICALLY
MOTIVATED AND PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS, AND WHICH, I BELIEVE, DESERVES
THE DENUNCIATION OF ALL HONDURANS.here

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WILL THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FORCES ADOPT ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES?here

   [AZCONA] YES, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT SOON.here  I HAVE A MEETING
SCHEDULED WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ALSO BE
ATTENDED BY THE THREE PRESIDENTS OF THE STATE BRANCHES.here  I MEAN, THE
[WORDS INDISTINCT] WILL CHAIR THE MEETING, AND NATIONAL CONGRESS
PRESIDENT CARLOS ARBIN MONTOYA AND SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT SALOMON
JIMENEZ CASTRO WILL ALSO ATTEND.here  WE HAVE ALSO INVITED THE CANDIDATES
OF THE TWO [NUMBER AS HEARD] PARTIES TO THIS MEETING SINCE ONE OF THEM
IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT HONDURAN PRESIDENT.here  WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH SOME
GUIDELINE--SOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED--NOT JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF
OUR TERM BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE FARSIGHTED
AND NOT JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE SHORT TERM, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY COMMON
IN HONDURAS, WHERE WE LOOK AND FIND SOLUTIONS ONLY FOR THE PRESENT.here
WE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS JOINTLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THE LONG RUN,
WHICH INCLUDES THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE.here  WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE
OURS, WHICH IS A VERY COMPLETE DEMOCRACY.here  IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE
INTERNAL ELECTIONS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES, WHERE CITIZENS ENJOY FULL
RIGHTS, WHERE PARTIES AND PARTY LEADERS CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE, WHERE
WE HAVE TRUE, CLEAN, AND HONEST ELECTIONS, WHERE WE HAVE A NATIONAL
ELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY NOR CAN IT BE
INFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHERE THE STATE BRANCHES ARE TOTALLY
INDEPENDENT.here

   ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE HONDURAS A DEMOCRACY, AND EVERY
SECTOR OF HONDURAN SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THEM BY AVOIDING
VIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS, OBEYING THE LAW, AND CONDEMNING AND ATTACKING
EXTREME TERRORIST GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION, THUS ENABLING US
TO CONSOLIDATE OUR DEMOCRACY AND REACH THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT
ATTAINED BY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.here

   IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WORLDWIDE THAT PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN
ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DEMOCRACY.here  THE FRG, THE MEDITERRANEAN
COUNTRIES--ITALY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN--ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS, AND THERE IS
THE CASE OF JAPAN, WHICH HAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND HAS ACHIEVED
EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT.here  TAIWAN IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE.here  AT
THIS STAGE.here.here.here

   [VALDES, INTERRUPTING] YES, BUT THIS TAKES TIME.here

   [AZCONA] YES.here  AT THIS STAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT
THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF
DEVELOPMENT.here  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT
THAT WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ENOUGH.here  EACH ONE OF US, EACH SECTOR, MUST
DO HIS PART TO MAKE IT WORK.here

   WHEN I MENTION SECTORS, I AM REFERRING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WHICH
MUST BE GENEROUS, EXHIBIT CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND SHOW MUCH
INITIATIVE; TO ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS, WHICH MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS
WITHOUT FOMENTING STRIKES AND OTHER DISORDERS, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT
ABOUT ILLEGALLY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORMAL LEGAL PROCEDURES; TO
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY,
BECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS MUST COMPLY WITH THEIR DUTIES; AND THE SAME GOES FOR
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.here

   IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS OR THE NEXT
GOVERNMENT ALONE.here  OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE TRANSITORY AND THEIR POWER IS
RELATIVE.here  I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES.here  THERE IS NO POINT IN LASHING OUT
AT THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE POWER IN HONDURAS IS RELATIVE AND CONDITIONAL.here
WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TOWARD HONDURAS'
DEVELOPMENT.here  THIS SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF PUBLIC
EMPLOYEES, BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND ORGANIZED PEASANTS, BUT ALL HONDURANS
SHOULD CONTRIBUTE.here  THAT IS WHAT COUNTS.here

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WHEN WILL THIS MEETING BE HELD AND WHAT IMMEDIATE
MEASURES WILL YOU PROPOSE?here

   [AZCONA] THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO
INVESTIGATE THE LATEST CRIME, WHICH WAS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE LIKE A
ROBBERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.here  THIS CRIME WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED.here  IT
WAS A TERRORIST ACT PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS.here

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE DEATH
PENALTY MIGHT BE A WAY TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.here  WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS?here

   [AZCONA] I RECENTLY READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IN A MEXICAN
MAGAZINE.here  THE DEATH PENALTY IS OPPOSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND HAS
BEEN ABOLISHED IN HONDURAS.here  I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION HERE
BECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS NOT SOLVED THE CRIME PROBLEM ANYWHERE ELSE IN
THE WORLD.here  FOR INSTANCE, THIS PENALTY EXISTS IN MANY U.hereS.here STATES, BUT THIS
HAS NOT DETERRED CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING TERRIBLE CRIMES.here  PEOPLE HAVE
LOST CONTROL.here  WHEN CRIMINALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, NOT
EVEN THE DEATH PENALTY CAN STOP THEM.here  HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRIMES, SUCH AS
DRUG TRAFFICKING, FOR WHICH NO BAIL SHOULD BE PERMITTED.here  I THINK A BILL
THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE PASSED BY
THE CONGRESS.here  OF COURSE, IT WILL BE APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT SO THOSE
FOUND GUILTY OF THIS CRIME CANNOT BE BAILED OUT.here  IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE
AUTHORITIES TO ARREST A DRUG TRAFFICKER ONLY TO SEE HIM RELEASED ON BAIL
BY A JUDGE WHO HAS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ABIDE BY THE LAW.here

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, THE FAR RIGHTIST GROUP AAA [ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION
ALLIANCE], THROUGH A LOCAL RADIO STATION, WARNED THAT THEY WILL TAKE
REVENGE ON MAJOR COMMUNIST LEADERS, SUCH AS JORGE ARTURO REINA, RAMON
CUSTODIO, AND OTHERS.here  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?here

   [AZCONA] I AM ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF REVENGE BECAUSE IT WOULD
ONLY LEAD TO ESCALATED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS.here  I CONDEMN THIS
ATTITUDE IN VIEW OF THE REGRETTABLE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ
MARTINEZ.here  AS FAR AS THE DEATH PENALTY GOES, IT WILL NOT BE A SOLUTION TO
THE CRIME PROBLEM.here

   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, CIVIC COMMITTEES HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN THE
COUNTRY.here

   [AZCONA] I AGREE, BUT THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE
AUTHORITIES.here  A CIVIC COMMITTEE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IS ONE THING, BUT IT
IS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO SUE THESE COMMITTEES TO PERFORM DUTIES THAT ARE
ALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE ARMED FORCES.here

   [VALDES] WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES MEET?here

   [AZCONA] THEY WILL MEET WHEN I RETURN FROM CARACAS.here

IRRESPONSIBLY SAID TO TWIST THE TRUTH SO THE PDC COULD AGAIN USE MSGR
ROMERO'S DEATH AS AN ELECTION ISSUE.here  IT IS ALL PART OF THE PDC'S
PROPAGANDA, BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL," D'AUBUISSON SAID.here

   "THE MOST REPREHENSIBLE THING IS THAT THE DUARTE ADMINISTRATION USES
RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS, OPENLY ABUSING ITS AUTHORITY, TO SLANDER
ME--SIMPLY BECAUSE I AM THE PDC'S POLITICAL ADVERSARY, AND BECAUSE THE PDC
HAS NO EXCUSE TO JUSTIFY THE CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN CAUSED BY ITS
CORRUPTION.here"

   D'AUBUISSON ADDED:  THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' "LIE" IS AIMED AT
DECEIVING SALVADORAN CATHOLICS.here  THAT IS DESPICABLE AND UNSPEAKABLE,
BECAUSE THEY ARE INSULTING MSGR ROMERO'S MEMORY.here

   THE PDC HAS GOVERNED THE COUNTRY FOR 8 YEARS.here  THE PDC CONTROLLED THE

QUESTION IS:  WHY WEREN'T THE NECESSARY MEASURES TAKEN TO CLARIFY THE CASE

TO PRESENT IT?here  AH, BECAUSE THIS WOULD END THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL GAME
OF SAYING THAT IT IS INVESTIGATING MSGR ROMERO'S DEATH!here  THIS ENTIRE
ATTITUDE IS REPREHENSIBLE, D'AUBUISSON STATED.here

MY WITNESS; MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR.here  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW MY GREAT
CRIME HAS BEEN TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE MARXIST-LENINISTS.here  THE PDC CANNOT
FORGIVE ME FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSELY LINKED WITH THOSE WHO "ARE
GREEN ON THE OUTSIDE [REFERENCE TO THE PDC'S PARTY COLORS] BUT RED ON THE

PARTY AFTER HAVING LOST THE ELECTIONS.here

DEFINITELY "MEANS THAT THE OLIGARCHY WILL REJOIN THE MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP.here"

   THE COMMANDERS ALSO EVALUATED THE LAST 5 YEARS OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST
THE DUARTE GOVERNMENT IN EL SALVADOR:

   SALVADOR SAMAYOA SAID:  "THE LAST 5 YEARS HAVE BEEN THE MOST
DIFFICULT.here  THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WE ARE CLOSER
TO DEFINING THE CONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR.here

   "IT HAS BEEN A LONG AND DIFFICULT WAR.here  THE ENEMY WAS ILL-DEFINED,
ENJOYING CERTAIN POPULARITY AMONG THE PEOPLE, MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO
TRY AND PERSUADE THEM THAT OUR REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE WAS A TERRORIST WAR
WHEN THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.here"

   ANA GUADALUPE MARTINEZ SAID:

   "I BELIEVE THAT THE EVENTS THAT BEGAN IN 1981 ARE COMING FULL CIRCLE
NOW, BUT NOW THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES.here

   "THE PDC EMERGED FROM A POPULAR STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP.here  NOW
THEY ARE IN OPPOSITION AND CAN DEAL WITH THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION AS
EQUALS, AND THAT IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR US.here

   WHEN MARTINEZ WAS ASKED HOW SHE WOULD DESCRIBE THE PDC'S ROLE IN EL
SALVADOR DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS, SHE REPLIED:

   "THE PDC PLAYED A VERY NEGATIVE ROLE.here  IT PROLONGED THE WAR THAT WOULD
HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN VERY MUCH SHORTER, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PDC MAY
DEVIATE FROM THEIR PAST BEHAVIOR AND PLAY A DIFFERENT ROLE THAN THE
OPPOSITION, FAVORING A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.here"
