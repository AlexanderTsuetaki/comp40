this file.

It is assumed that you have already read and worked through the
introductory steps in
http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40/labs/bits-and-shifts . If you have
not, please do so now.

In all of the following questions, all variables are assumed to be of
signed or unsigned C integral types; we are not asking about floats,
doubles, pointers, etc.

If you are shaky on hex, then spend some time just entering positive
and negative numbers into the interpreter, to see what they become in
hex. Then, try it the other way: enter a hex literal like 0x102 and
see how it evaluates. note that by default in C, expressions are 32
bit and signed. Prepare to enter 0xfffffffe, but first guess what the
decimal equivalent will be. Did you guess right?

Now go on to answer the following questions. You may use the
c_interpret program to help you figure out the following or to check
your answers.

===============================================
        Practice with numbers
===============================================

Try to figure these out in your head or on paper before confirming
using the interpreter

Fill in your answer in the space under each question:

* Asssuming variable x is an unsigned integer, what will the
  expression: x | 1 compute?

 x|1 will compare every bit to 0000 0000 0000 0001 with an or, so the new number
will be the combination of all the 1 bits. i.e if x = 0000 1111 0001 0000
then the result will be 0000 1111 0001 0001;


* Write an expression that will evaluate to "True" (I.e. a nonzero
  value) if and only if unsigned integer x is odd. You MUST NOT use
  the mod operator. Good answers will use only a single C operator,
  but other interesting ones are possible using two or more
  operators. Do your best. (Hint: think about what even and odd
  numbers look like in binary.)

if(x & 1); as the and will make all values in x 0 except for the last one which
can be 1 or 0. if x's last digit is odd the last digit will be a 1 making x&1
= 1 which is not 0. 


* Would your answer change, and if so how, if x were a signed integer
  instead of unsigned?

it wouldn't have to since odd negative numbers will still have a 1 in the last
binary digit


===============================================
        Practice with Hex and Shifts
===============================================


Fill in your answer in the space under each question:

* Give a number in decimal, that is equal to the
  hex value 0x202.

2*16^2 + 0*16^1 + 2*16^0 = 514

* Give a C expression using operators OTHER THAN (+ - * or /) that
  will multiply the unsigned variable "a" by 16:

 a << 4

* Will the above expression work for a signed variable?

no since it can shift 0000 1000 0000 0000 2048 into 1000 0000 0000 0000 
which is -1

* Give a C expression using operators OTHER THAN (+ - * or /) that
  will divide the unsigned variable variable "a" by 16:

a >> 4

* Will the above expression work for a signed variable?

no as it can take -1 or 1000 0000 0000 0000 into 2018 0000 1000 0000 0000


* Give a C expression using operators OTHER THAN (+ - * / or % ) that will
  yield the remainder when the unsigned variable "a" is divided by 8: 

a & 7 ==> a & 0000 0000 0000 0111 -> just the last 3 (or non divisable by 8) 
           value

===============================================
              Masks and masking
===============================================

Assume the following declarations:

  uint16_t width = ...some number between 0 and 31 ...
  uint16_t lsb   = ......some number between 0 and 31 ...
  uint32_t bits  = ...some value (bit fields)....

  Assume the same naming conventions as in the arith bitpack
  assignment. "lsb" identifies the least significant bit of a bit field,
  with 0 being the "rightmost". "width" gives the number of bits.

* Fill in the expression so that mask has 1 bits in
  the bit positions lsb -> lsb + width - 1, and zeros everywhere
  else. For example: if lsb = 4 and width = 8, the hex value
  of the mask should be: 0x00000ff0 (8 bits starting at position 4).

  If it's easier, you may declare some variables to hold intermediate
  values first, or you can just do it all on one expression:





  uint32_t mask = lsb >> lsb << lsb+lsb+width-1

* Assume the mask above is correctly computed, and that lsb and width
  are still available. Write an expression (using mask, lsb, and width
  as appropriate) to extract an unsigned integer of width "width" from
  position "lsb" in variable data.

  For example: if data = 0x12345678, then for the sample values above,
  the result would be 0x67 (the 8 bits of data starting at lsb 4).

  Provide your expression below. Note that it should not work only for
  the sample values 8 and 4, but should work for any values of width,
  lsb, and bits. Again, you can use the mask value computed above if you
  like. 


  Your expression here: lsb = lsb << total - (lsb-width) >> lsb  



===============================================
            Named Flags  
===============================================

In the table in the lab writeup, the following flag definitions are shown:

uint32_t REGISTERED = 0x80000000
uint32_t EVALUATED = 0x40000000
uint32_t QUEUED = 0x20000000
uint32_t DROPPED = 0x10000000
uint32_t UNDERGRADUATE = 0x080000

These are also available in your cloned directory in the file
"namedflags.cfrag". So, the following command will read in those
definitions and then let you evaluable expressions using them:

     c_interpret namedflags.cfrag -       

(Note the '-' at the end; without that, the interpreter won't wait for
more input from you).


Also assume the usual C conventions for True and False; the value 0 is
false, any other integer value is True. 

* Write a declaration for flags that sets the flags REGISTERED and
  UNDERGRADUATE, but no others:

    uint32_t flags =  0X8800 0000

In the following, assume that flags is a uint32_t, but that the flags
could have any value. For example, when doing the second question
below, do not assume that the first has already run to turn off the
UNDERGRADUATE flag. 


* Write an expression that evaluates to True if and only if 
  the UNDERGRADUATE flag is on in flags:

flags << 4 >> 8


* Write an assignment statement that turns off the the REGISTERED in
  "flags", but leaves all other flags unchanged (




* Write an expression that evaluates to "True" (any nonzero value) if
  and only if both the UNDERGRADUATE and DROPPED flags are on.
