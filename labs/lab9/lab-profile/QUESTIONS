UNBLACKEDGES

Please put answers to questions here.

  1. What fraction of time is spent in I/O as compared with removing
     black edges?
     
     100%-43.66% = 56.34% 
       
  2. How long does
  
        time ./unblackedges 
  
     take?

  0.71user 0.01system 0:00.74elapsed 96%CPU 
  (0avgtext+0avgdata 31232maxresident)k
  0inputs+0outputs (0major+4844minor)pagefaults 0swaps

  3. After making changes requested in the lab handout (steps 1-4), what
     happened to the total time?
0.70user 0.00system 0:00.75elapsed 94%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 5492maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+1486minor)pagefaults 0swaps

		 It stayed the same
  
  4. What happened to the fraction of time spent in Bit_put?
    
    first =  7.29%
    second = 7.39%
    the proportion of time spend in Bit put increased

  5. Since the implementation of Bit_put has not been improved, what has
     changed?
  
  not much changed, but the number of times that Bit_put is called to begin with
  has decreased.
